# PythonCracker
Python Cracker is a brute force password cracker (designed to crack hashes using a brute force dictionary attack) written in Python.
This should be _pretty_ self explanatory. 

To run, just clone this repo and then run the `cracker.py` in your Python environment.
This will import the two lists (you'll need to unzip `unmasked.lst.zip` first) and then begin to brute force the passwords included in them.
